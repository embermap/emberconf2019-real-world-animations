# EmberConf 2019 Training â€“Â Real-World Animations

Hi there!

We're super excited that you're attending our **Real-World Animations** training at EmberConf on Monday. ðŸ˜€

Follow the steps below to make sure your computer is set up with our training app.

Conference WiFi isn't super reliable, so we recommend doing the setup ahead of time, at home or work.

We'll ask that you `git pull` one more time the morning of the training to get the latest code.

# Setup

> We're using a few new addons, so if you have any trouble getting started just shoot us an email at [hello@embermap.com](mailto:hello@embermap.com).

## Node.js

We're using Node.js 10.15.x, which is the current LTS version.

## App

1. Open terminal
2. Clone this git repository: `git clone git@github.com:embermap/emberconf2019-real-world-animations.git`
3. Move into the directory: `cd emberconf2019-real-world-animations`
4. Run NPM install: `npm install` (You might get some warnings, thats ok!)
